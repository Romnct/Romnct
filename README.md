Hi! I'm Romnct (or Rafael) and I'm currently training in the world of deveploment. I still haven't choosen a main branch where focus, but I'd like to become a big data analyst professional. Let's just say that until then I still have a lot of things to learn. I find this world exciting. Day and night I think about the new knowledge I acquire and I want many more.
